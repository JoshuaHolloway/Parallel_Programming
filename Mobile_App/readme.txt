SVM in Android

Step 1: Pass data from Java to C++ in android.

Step 2: Do step 1 with code generated from MATLAB:
	2.a) Arrays
	2.b) Matrices

Step 3: Repeat step 2 with C++ code generated from MATLAB using the SVM model trained in MATLAB.

Step 4: Pass in data matrix from accelerometer readings from Android app into function from step 3.
