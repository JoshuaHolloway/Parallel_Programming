This dude's explanation is very good.  He explains how to get the SDK instead of Android Stdio.

Download Eclipse Neon with Android Support:
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-android-developers-includes-incubating-components/neon3

I downloaded the ADT from here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28991505/download-link-to-android-sdk-with-eclipse

I unzipped it to my home directory, which is here:
/home/josh/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702


Then, I followed the dude's video (see first link) to download the java SDK from the 
android studio website and downloading the "Command line tools" (sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip)

I decompressed it an placed it inside the ADT directory (it is called tools):
/home/josh/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702/tools


I placed the eclpse neon download in the ADT directory here:
/home/josh/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702/eclipse_neon

Step 1: 
cd to the directory, and sudo ./ open the install file.
$ cd /home/josh/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702/eclipse_neon
$ sudo ./eclipse

It seems to not install, and asks which workspace to use.
Even after completely uninstalling eclipse, still I get this same thing of not seeming to install.

After selecting the workspace, I get a message that says:
"A valide AVD was not detected. Do you want to create one?" 
I selected no.

Go to  help -> Install New Software:
Work With: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse

Select all developer tools and select next.
Select Next again, accept liscense and begin install.

Restart eclipse when installation is complete.

The SDK, which I downloaded at the beginning of this doc, is now used.
Close eclipse and re-open it.
Then go to Windows->Preferences.
Android -> Browse (next to SDK Location)

Next, is used the SDK folder from the ADT download instead of the SDK as decribed from old dude.

Navigate to the downloaded SDK and select it:
/home/josh/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702/sdk

Note that I renamed the sdk directory to: android-sdk-linux

Select OK.

The android SDK manager does not open automatically.
Select Window -> Android SDK Manager

Install the following if they are not already installed:
-Android SDK Tools
-Android SDK Platform-tools
-Android SDK Build-tools
-Android 8.1.0 (API 27):
	-SDK Platform
	-Sources for Android SDK

=============

Now, I do the instructions from the MATLAB to Android made easy webinar:
https://www.mathworks.com/videos/matlab-to-iphone-and-android-made-easy-107779.html?elqsid=1522651944900&potential_use=Student

Open the demo in MATLAB:
$ MATLAB&
$ cd /home/josh/Desktop/Parallel_Vision_Research/Mobile_App/MATLAB-to-Android


cd to the directory with the source code:
$ cd /home/josh/Desktop/Parallel_Vision_Research/Mobile_App/MATLAB-to-Android/matlabCode/myCorners

Open myCorners.m and then followed the "MATLAB to C Made Easy" webinar to get generate code:
https://www.mathworks.com/videos/matlab-to-c-made-easy-81870.html

Open MATLAB coder and follow the instructions.

I got an error about the vision functions, but it runs in the MATLAB script.
I suspect it is because the program does not know how to generate these functions
in C/C++ because it does not know where OpenCV is.
I think I need to add OpenCV to MATLAB as described here:
https://www.mathworks.com/videos/using-opencv-with-matlab-97710.html

The error was actually that the vision objects have been deprecated and replaced in the current 
version of MATLAB!

I simply erased all the vision objects with a the simplest possible operation.

Restart eclipse.

-------
I then installed the NDK as described here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2onPuDZQVY

This is the repo to the eclipse CDT for neon here:
http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/9.2

Help -> Intall new software ->add
Name: CDT
Location: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/9.2

Select "CDT Main Features" and select "Next", "Next", "Finish".


Windows -> install new software

The ADT option is not there.  I am re-installing it as described here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQK9Bcj5EB4

Windows -> install new software -> Add:
Name: ADT
Location: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

Downloaded the NDK file from here:
https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html#stable-downloads

and I put that shit here:
/home/josh/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140702


========================================
Remember that you modified the code from the accelorometer machine learning example from here:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50232-machine-learning-made-easy

Code is in the mobile systems directory in the repo.

There is a corresponding explanation of how to generate C-code using the machine learning tool here:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/c-generate-code-and-classification-learner.html

For the project, need to generate C-code of the machine learning model, and then map it into the android app.
